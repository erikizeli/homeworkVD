## Main Homework:
Magnifying Glass with zoom and saturation

I tried to create the "Main Homework" version to follows the base description as much as possible without the extra tasks, except the glass not leaving the image border. We can scroll to set the zoom value and use arrow keys to adjust saturation.

## Extra Homework:

This version has all three extra tasks plus some that I've added myself. We can adjust the magnifying glass attributes such as size, border radius or max zoom level. We can scroll to set zoom, pressing r, g or b will select a color and we can adjust it with the arrow keys. We have a delay on the glass and it wont leave the border. We can also adjust the RGB values of the magnifying glass. Here I added another image quality controller. Because the base image is so high quality we start with a low quality image and can change to the high quality whenever we want.

### Adjust the attributes of the magnifying glass

### Set the image quality. Due to the huge size of the image the code would be really slow, so we use a low quality magnifying glass first and can set it to high quality when we want.
It might take a couple of seconds but it will change to the high value image.
